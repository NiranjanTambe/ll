title: "More on: What is LaTeX and how does it work?"

The word "LaTeX" actually consists of two components, "La" and "TeX". In the
following we will briefly describe where they come from.

TeX was originally invented by the Stanford professor Donald Knuth. Knuth is
well-known for a series of books known as the "Art of Computer Programming". In
1973 a new edition of the books was to be made, this was the time when the
typesetting industry switched from traditional typesetting with lead to
photobased typesetting. Donald Knuth did not like the quality of the print and
therefore decided to implement his own typesetting system.

In May 1977 the development of {{ site.tex }} started.

The original {{ site.tex }} was rather complicated to use, even Donald Knuth used various
macros to edit his books. Leslie Lamport, who works for Microsoft nowadays, also
developed a set of macros which simplify the use of TeX and called this macro
set "LaTeX".

Today {{ site.latex }} is the most common way to interact with {{ site.tex }}. Another alternative is
[ConTeXt](https://www.contextgarden.net/).
